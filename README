IP ACL Daemon.

This daemon reads the configuration file (defaults to ipacl.conf in the
current working directory; you can specify a configuration file on the 
command line) specifying which users can bind to which IP (or IPv6) ports.

It then listens for datagrams on /dev/ipacl.  When it receives one, it
checks the credentials of the sending process, and if allowed, will create
and bind to the requested IP port and send it to the requesting process.

Known limitations at this point:

	* only IP addresses allowed
	* only users can be specified, no groups
	* only IP and IPv6 addresses allowed.
	* only TCP, UDP and RAW sockets created
	* only Lua bindings are available (yes, you'll have to check the
	  source if you want C bindings)
	* only runs in the foreground (but there's a reason for this)

This is more of a proof-of-concept at this stage, but it work, and I'm
surprised that nothing like this hasn't already been written.  What an odd
omission.
